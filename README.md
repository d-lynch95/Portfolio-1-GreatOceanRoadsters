## Design

### Font
The design of this website was based off a very minimalist natural style. We wanted the photos to do most of the heavy lifting so we've opted to go with very visually striking hero images with strong colours of blue, green and yellow. In order to allow the photos to stand out we've gone for a minimalist white background with black text so as to not distract from the photos. 

We wanted a bohemian style logo for the website so we opted to use the 'Satisfy' font from Google fonts. We noticed that this font did not work well for the other headers so we changed the font to 'Unbounded' for the rest of the text and we found this font worked very well for the theme we were going for. Using Google font pairings we opted to use 'Lora' for the main body

### Structure

We went for a simple four page website with a confirmation page following form submission and an error 404 page with a link back to the homepage. We found this format was easiest to allow users to navigate the website and achieve their user goals without the website becoming too complicated or clutered.

### Wireframe

The site has developed a lot since the original wireframes were created. The original wirerames were not created in a mobile first environment and instead reflect a desktop site. This was an interesting learning experience during this project. In future we will develop websites in a mobile first environment.

## Features 

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Gallery, Itinerary and Contact us page. The nav bar on each page is the exact same to allow for ease of navigation.
  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button. 

![Nav Bar](media/nav.webp)

- __The landing page image__

  - The landing includes a photograph with text overlay to allow the user to know the exact purpose of the website.

![Landing Page](media/landing.webp)

- __Attractions section__

  - The attractions section allows the user to see some of the highlights of the Great Ocean Road and some of the activities or sights they will encounter along the way.  
  - There are two calls to action under the attractions section. One is a 'Find out more' CTA which will link the user to the Itinerary page. The other is a "Contact us" CTA which will link the user to the Contact us page where the user can fill out their details and submit a form to acquire  further information. Both of these buttons will open the page in a new tab to allow the user to return easily to where they had been.

![Attractions](media/attractions.webp)

  - The footer is the same on all of the webpages to allow for standardisation and ease of use.

![Footer](media/footer.webp)

- __Itinerary Page__

  - This page will allow the user to view a sample three day itinerary. The page will provide links to the different activities but will not provide too much information. The page will contain links to websites for different activities and also includes a link to our contact page.

![Error 404](media/error404.webp)

### Features Left to Implement

- I would like to add a hamburger menu for mobile and tablet devices for this site when I have the requisite knowledge.

- I would like to format the server in the future to accept form submissions and allow the site owner to view users form submissions.

## Testing 

### BUGS
 - I encountered several bugs while creating this project.

 - There were issues with the icons and social media links located in the footer. I struggled to correctly format links to the external sites while creating links in the icons.
  This was corrected by adding "HTTPS://" to the front of the href aswell aswell as adding the target="_blank" attribute.
  I was also having issues with the icons duplicating themselves with one icon having an active link and the second icon not having a link. This was due to an issue with missing closing tags on our <i> element and was quickly corrected after some testing.

 - There was an issue when creating the hero image for the landing page. When adding the hero image the nav bar would disappear. This issue was temporarily fixed by removing the 'position:fixed;' attribute. We still wanted the Nav bar to be fixed so we corrected this by setting the z-index to 1.

 - The attractions section on the index page caused a lot of issues as this was the first time working with flexbox. The [Academind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSIclWvNTdQ) youtube tutorial on CSS V Flexbox was very helpful to resolve these issues.

 - When uploading the photos for the attractions page I spent a lot of time struggling with the format of one image. I could not figure out why the css was not working on this one image but had formatted all of the other images correctly. In the end I gave up and opted to change the image. When I changed the image to one of a similar theme the image responded to the css immediately. In hindsight I think the issue may be that the original image was in portrait mode and all of the other images were in landscape.

 - While creating the hamburger menu I struggled a lot with a certain bug. I was able to format the menu but could not manage to get the menu to open. I struggled with this for a long time until an online blog I was reading suggested moving the script tag to after where the element is declared. I moved the script tag to the bottom of the html page and the hamburger menu began to work. 

 - The hamburger menu was creating an issue that when the site is viewed on mobile or tablet sized screens (< 768px) the hamburger menu appears at the left side of the screen as an opaque rectangular box. When the hamburger menu is clicked this menu slides out from the left to fill the screen. As this functionality was borrowed from an online tutorial I have struggled to fix this bug as I do not have the required Javascript knowledge yet. Instead I opted to remove the hamburger menu in favour of a different style of menu for mobile and tablet devices.

 - I tried to create a pair of buttons on the index page with class to action of Find Out More and Contact Us. I nested an anchor tag within the button but this did not pass html validation. I searched on [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6393827/can-i-nest-a-button-element-inside-an-a-using-html5) and found a solution. In the end I opted to keep the a tag and style it with CSS to resemble a button.

  - Once the site was deployed I had issues with viewing the hero images on each page. This was due to the use of absolute file paths. Once we changed them to relative file paths the images loaded without issues.

  - There was an issue with the confirmation.html page. This page was supposed to be the destination for form submission. After receiving help from Sean Young on slack I was told that we do not yet have the requisite knowledge to format the server to accept form submissions. I have added a submission confirmation page but do not have the server formatted to accept form submissions.
  
  - The footer has underlines in the spaces between the social media icons. User inc21 on slack pointed out that these could be removed by adding a text-decoration:none to the css. This removed the issues with the underline.
  
### User Testing

The site was tested on chrome, safari and opera browsers on desktop without any issues. The site was tested on desktop, tablet and mobile using chrome developer tools. The actual tablet testing was done on an ipad. The mobile testing was done on an iphone 12 using the safari browser and also tested on android devices OnePlus 7 and OnePlus Nord CE on chrome browsers. The site was also tested on a samsung phone using the opera browser. None of the tablet or mobile devices presented any issues.

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&doc=https%3A%2F%2Fd-lynch95.github.io%2FPortfolio-1-GreatOceanRoadsters%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd-lynch95.github.io%2FPortfolio-1-GreatOceanRoadsters%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)


### Manual Testing

#### Functional Testing 

We tested the links in the navigation section of the header for all pages on multiple devices.

| Navigation link  | Page to load  |
| -----------      | -----------   |
| Logo             | index.html    |
| Home             | index.html    |
| Itinerary        | itinerary.html|
| Gallery          | gallery.html  |
| Contact Us       | contact.html  |

All of these links worked as expected and lead to the correct pages.

We tested the two buttons on the index page. The "Find out more" button links to the itinerary.html page in a new tab. This worked without any issues.
The Contact Us button takes us to contactus.html in a new tab. This did not present any issues.

When the FAQ section questions are clicked the answer should appear beneath in a details and summary section. We tested this for all of the questions on multiple browsers on desktop, mobile and tablet. All of the questions present the answers when clicked as expected.

We also tested the social media links at the bottom of the page and they all led to the respective social media sites.



### Unfixed Bugs
 - There are no current bugs that we're aware of.
